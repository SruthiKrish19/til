# Code Obfuscation

Obfuscation means to make something difficult to understand. Code is often obfuscated to protect intellectual property or trade secrets, and to prevent an attacker from reverse engineering a proprietary software program.

### Methods for Obfuscation
Encrypting some or all of a program's code is one obfuscation method. 
Stripping out potentially revealing metadata.
Replacing class and variable names with meaningless labels.
Adding unused or meaningless code to an application script.
Packing, This compresses the entire program to make the code unreadable.
Code transposition. This is the reordering of routines and branches in the code without having a visible effect on its behavior.

A tool called an obfuscator will automatically convert straightforward source code into a program that works as intended, but is more difficult to read, understand.

### Measuring Obfuscation
The success of obfuscation methods can be measured using the following criteria:
1. **Strength:** The extent to which transformed code resists automated de-obfuscation attempts determines its strength.
2. **Differentiation:** The degree to which transformed code differs from the original code.
3. **Expense:** A cost-efficient obfuscation method will be more useful than an expensive method, particularly if it scales well for larger applications.
4. **Complexity** The more layers the obfuscator adds, the more complex the program will be, making the obfuscation more successful.
