# GitMoji's
GitMoji's or Git Emojis are a set of custom emoji symbols used in commit messages or code comments to provide extra context and expression to the changes being made to a codebase. They are usually added along with a commit message to help convey the nature of the changes made in a more visually expressive and fun way.

## Example
Git emojis consist of a shortcode representation of an emoji symbol, such as :bug: (üêõ) for a bug fix or :sparkles: (‚ú®) for a new feature. They can be added to the beginning or end of a commit message or code comment to indicate the nature of the changes being made.
`git commit -m ":bug: Fix Bug <bug_id>"`
